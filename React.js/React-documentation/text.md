Question No.1=>What is React?
ans.
React is often referred to as a "frontend" or "UI" library because it's primarily used for the presentation layer of web applications.



Question No.2=>Who made React?
ans.
Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, initially developed React, and it was first released as an open-source project by Facebook in 2013.


Question No.3 =>What is Babel?
ans.Babel is a tool that helps bridge the gap between modern JavaScript development and the need for compatibility with older browsers and environments. It allows developers to write more expressive and efficient code while ensuring it can run in a broader range of settings.



Questiion No.4=>How does Babel convert html code in React into valid code?
ans.
Babel doesn't convert HTML code but processes JSX code, transforming it into valid JavaScript code that can be executed by browsers. The React library is used alongside Babel to make this transformed code functional and render user interfaces.







Questiion No.5=>What is ReactDOM used for? Write an example?
ans.ReactDOM is a library in the React ecosystem that is specifically designed for rendering React components into the DOM (Document Object Model). It provides the necessary tools to take your React components and display them as actual elements on a web page.

Example:-
Assuming you have an HTML file with an element with the id "root," this code will render the "Hello, ReactDOM!" message inside that element when your React application starts. React will take care of updating the DOM efficiently as your application's state changes.

So, ReactDOM is a critical part of React that handles the interaction between your React components and the actual web page, making it possible to display your UI on the screen.


Questiion No.6=>What are the packages that you need to import for react to work with?
ans.React and ReactDom, These two packages are fundamental to creating and rendering React components in a web application. However, the specific dependencies you need may vary depending on your project's complexity and requirements.





Questiion No.7=>How do you add react to a web application?
ans.The steps to add react to a web application are as follows:-

Step1->Create a New React Application with the help of tool like "create-react-app".Replace my-react-app with the name of your project.

Step2->Navigate to Your Project Directory:

Step3->Start the Development Server by giving command "npm start".

Step4->Edit Your React Components  to build your application by creating new components and defining their 
behavior.

Step5->Add Additional Dependencies by "npm install package-name"

Step6->Import and Use React Components

Step7->Render React Components by" ReactDOM.render". Typically, this is done in the index.js file.

Step8->Build and Deploy




Questiion No.8=>What is React.createElement?
ans.

React.createElement is a fundamental function in React that is used to create React elements, which are the building blocks of React applications. It is an essential part of how React renders and manages components and their content.



Questiion No.9=>What are the three properties that createElement accept?
ans.The three properties that createElement accept are as follows:-

1.
Type: The type of element to create. This can be a string representing an HTML element (e.g., 'div', 'h1', 'p') or a reference to a custom React component (e.g., MyComponent).

2.
props (optional): An object that contains the properties or attributes to be assigned to the element/component.

3.
 ...children (optional): Any additional arguments passed to React.createElement represent the children of the element. These can be other elements or strings representing text content.





Questiion No.10=> What is the meaning of render and root?
ans.
Render:In React, rendering is the process of converting React elements and components into actual HTML elements that can be seen and interacted with by the user.

Root:Root often refers to the top-level element in a web application's HTML structure where all other content is nested. In the context of React, it's a specific DOM element where you mount (render) your React application. It serves as the entry point for your React component hierarchy. You might see code like this in a React application.
